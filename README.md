## Installation
To install this application, follow the below instructions:
- First, make sure you have an independent development environment (IDE) like VSCode installed onto your computer.
- Second, make sure to have Node.js installed. This program was created in Node.js version 14.17.1.
- Third, make sure you have Git installed on your machine. At time of creation, I use version 2.30.0.windows.2.
- Fourth, install MongoDB.
- Fifth, clone the github repository for this project to your local machine.
- Sixth, Navigate to your local folder containing the repo and use the `npm i` command to install all dependencies (express.js and mongoose.js, namely).
- Seventh, Enter the command `npm start` to activate your server.
- And finally, Use Insomnia or Postman or another such software for making direct CRUD calls. The routes can be found in the `routes` folder, but a good place to start is `/api/users` to get all users with a GET call!
